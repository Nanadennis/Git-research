Possible reasons for the message "error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Nanadennis/version-control.git"
Information from Chatgpt

1. Remote Branch is Ahead of Local Branch
The remote branch has commits that your local branch does not. Git prevents you from pushing to avoid overwriting these commits.

2. Local and Remote Branches Have Diverged
Both your local and remote branches have unique commits that the other branch does not have. This divergence requires resolving conflicts before pushing.

3. Non-Fast-Forward Updates
Git is unable to fast-forward your local branch to the remote branch. This can happen if the remote branch has new commits since the last pull.

4. Protected Branch
The branch you're trying to push to might be protected. GitHub can restrict direct pushes to certain branches, often requiring pull requests instead.

5. Permissions Issue
There might be a permissions issue where you do not have the necessary rights to push to the repository.
